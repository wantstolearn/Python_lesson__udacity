#locate and print the start character where the <a href string starts

print page.find ('<a href=')

#then store that position in a variable

hreftext_startposition = page.find ('<a href=')

# now add 9 to that to get the start of the link becasue 9 =  the length of the string <a href=' . Obviously there is an asssumption that all are psace the same

# the final letter in the string "www....com" is the letter m
# so store that in a variable next

end_string = "m"

# now search for m starting at the start of the link

2) so then redo with > instead of M as the assumed stop characater
