# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.

# The Python code should be general enough
# to pass every possible case where 'zip' 
# can occur in a string

# Here are two example test cases:
#text = 'all zip files are zipped' 
# >>> 18
#text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1
text= "hello"
#ext = "all zip files are zipped" 

# ENTER CODE BELOW HERE

def zip(text):
    x=0
    counter=0
    while x<len(text)-2:
            
            if text[x]=="z" and text [x+1]=="i" and text [x+2]=="p":
                counter=counter+1
                x=x+1
                if counter ==2:
                    return x-1
                
            else:
                x=x+1
                if x ==len(text)-2 and counter<2:
                    return -1
    return  


# IMPORTANT BEFORE SUBMITTING: 
# You should only have one print command in your function
print zip(text)
